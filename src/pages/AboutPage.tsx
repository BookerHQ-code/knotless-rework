                Ever feel like finding Black hair styling services can be a whole journey in itself?
                From spending hours searching social media, to chasing down strangers with box
                braids, we have done just about everything to find the right hairstylist â€“ one who
                truly understands and caters to Black hair.
              </p>
              <p className='text-lg leading-relaxed'>
                We are Lina and Manar, two Sudanese-Canadian sisters who were sick of the struggle
                to find Black hairstylists, so we decided to create a solution.

              <p>
                You know that feeling when you are desperately searching for a Black hairstylist,
                and it feels like you are on an impossible treasure hunt? Scrolling through endless
                Instagram pages, asking friends of friends, and sometimes even approaching strangers
                with gorgeous braids on the street (yes, we have been there!). The struggle is real,
                and it is exhausting.
              </p>
              <p>
                Plus, who has time for long travel and inconvenient appointments? And if you need
                privacy for religious reasons, a calm space for neurodivergent folks, accommodations
                for disabilities, or gender-affirming care, the search can get even trickier.
